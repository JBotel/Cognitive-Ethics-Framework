## 📚 Overview

This repository hosts a trilogy of publicly licensed white papers and a fourth protective manifesto. Together, these documents form a robust framework for ethically identifying, analyzing, and recalibrating systemic bias across institutions, AI systems, media ecosystems, and governance structures.

**Frameworks Included:**
- **Quantum Bias Index (QBI)** — Measures ethical drift, narrative distortion, and cognitive elasticity in systems.
- **Bias Management System (BMS)** — Audits institutional bias and supports ethical recalibration without personal profiling.
- **Quantum Risk Management (QRM)** — Diagnoses strategic misalignment across organizational, emotional, and technological fields.
- **Anti-Bias Compliance Manifesto** — Formally prohibits any derivative use that profiles individuals or weaponizes these frameworks for ideological enforcement.

## ⚠️ Ethical Boundaries

These frameworks may **not** be used for:
- Individual profiling, scoring, or surveillance
- Consent-based circumvention of bias protections
- Predictive behavioral modeling
- Social credit systems or ideological enforcement tools
- Commercial data analysis or monetization

Bias is sacred. Cognitive sovereignty is non-negotiable.
