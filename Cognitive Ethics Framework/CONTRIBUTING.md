# Contributing to the Cognitive Ethics Frameworks

We welcome contributions, adaptations, translations, and ethical extensions — under strict compliance with the foundational principles of this project.

## Before You Begin
All contributors must agree to the following conditions:

- **No contributions may violate the Cognitive Sovereignty Clause**
- **No individual bias, belief, or thought profiling tools may be proposed**
- **No scoring, ranking, or surveillance mechanisms may be added**
- **All tools must remain non-commercial unless profits support public education**

## Guidelines
- Fork this repository and create your branch from `main`
- Keep pull requests focused and well-documented
- Do not alter original white papers — instead, add derivative adaptations to `/Derived/` with a clear purpose

## Attribution
All new work must:
- Retain the original author citation
- Include the original license
- Maintain strict ethical boundaries

> If your intent is ethical alignment, public good, and respect for cognitive sovereignty — welcome.
